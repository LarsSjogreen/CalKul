# CalKul
An RPN calculator written in C#. For the moment only handles doubles, strings, booleans and a few operators.

## Why?
For now? Just for fun. Also to have a simple calculator with some RPN/RPL capacity in PowerShell or Bash.

## Todo
* [x] Move from supporting only double to supporting objects on stack
* [x] Add tan, rand, ==, <, >
* [ ] Add asin, acos, atan, 1/x, !, ln, e^x, 10^x and log
* [ ] Add more RPL words for stack manipulation
* [ ] Add more RPL words for conditionals
* [ ] Do crazy stuff with URLs
* [ ] Test other user interface?
* [x] Add variables
* [ ] Add variable persistence

## Ideas for the future
Lots. No promises though.
* Sound
* wget/curl like functionality
* Supporting HTTP verbs
* Supporting images
* DSL?
* Bash/PowerShell command support
* Supporting all kinds of .NET types for Windows instrumentation and other craziness
