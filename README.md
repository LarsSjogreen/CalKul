# CalKul
An RPN calculator written in C#. For the moment only handles doubles and a few operators.

## Why?
For now? Just for fun. Also to have a simple calculator with some RPN/RPL capacity in PowerShell or Bash.

## Todo
* Move from supporting only double to supporting objects on stack
* Add more RPL words
* Do crazy stuff
* Test other user interface?
* Add variables and persistence

## Ideas for the future
Lots. No promises though.
* Sound
* wget/curl like functionality
* Supporting HTTP verbs
* Supporting images
* DSL?
* Bash/PowerShell command support
* Supporting all kinds of .NET types for Windows instrumentation and other craziness
